-------------------
worked on codecademy till 27%
i did the assigning, methods, boolean operators until loops and iterator(.times)
codecademy is very helpful because it gives you the chance to think and revises the topic one took instead of just following steps without understanding.
creating a branch but couln't checkout the new branch resulting in inability to push on it anything
