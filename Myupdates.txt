-------------------
worked on codecademy till 27%
i did the assigning, methods, boolean operators until loops and iterator(.times)
codecademy is very helpful because it gives you the chance to think and revises the topic one took instead of just following steps without understanding.
creating a branch but couln't checkout the new branch resulting in inability to push on it anything

---------------------
today, I only did till 45% of the codecademy tutorial for ruby because i was stuck for 2 hours in one step and didn't know how to solve it. 
i also only created a file for tagging but didn't decide on the best method to.
but still I didn't achive something in the actual coding.
